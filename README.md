# SoloBedEnergize
Stardew Valley Mod - Allows the Farmer to have the Health and Stamina recharge functionality when laying in bed for single player sessions, and for co-op session with **only** one player.

Co-op sessions with more than 1 player have this functionality built in, so this mod seizes from manipulating the player's health and energy values.

This is the raw source code for this mod.
